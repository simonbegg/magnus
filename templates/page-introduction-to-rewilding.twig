        description: 'Rewilding is the restoration of ecosystems by allowing natural processes to return and flourish. It ranges from minimal interventions that let nature lead the way to active restoration of key habitats. Whether you have a garden, community space, farm, or estate, rewilding can be adapted to suit your land and goals.',

			<p class="mt-8 text-xl text-white">Have you ever wondered what Scotland might look like if nature had a little more freedom? That's the essence of rewilding. It's about restoring ecosystems to a point where natural processes can shape the land and its wildlife. Think of it as stepping back and allowing nature to take the reins, helping to repair damaged ecosystems and create richer, more resilient environments.</p>
			<p class="mt-8 text-xl text-white">Rewilding isn't about abandoning land or turning back the clock to a specific point in history. Instead, it's a forward-looking approach that works with nature to build healthier landscapes for the future. It involves restoring natural processes like woodland regeneration, river meandering, and the interactions between plants and animals. Sometimes this means active interventions, like planting native trees or restoring peatlands, but often it's about reducing human pressures – such as grazing – and letting nature recover on its own.</p>
			<p class="mt-8 text-xl text-white">The rewilding movement has gained momentum across the globe, and Scotland, with its dramatic landscapes and unique natural heritage, offers incredible potential. From the Flow Country's vast peatlands to the remnants of the Caledonian Forest, opportunities abound to restore ecosystems and the wildlife they support.</p>

			<h3 class="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-balance 2xl:text-7xl">Guiding Principles for Restoring Nature</h3>
			<p class="mt-8 text-xl">Rewilding is guided by several core principles that emphasise natural processes and long-term ecological health. These principles help shape projects and ensure they contribute effectively to nature restoration.</p>
			<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-4 gap-8 mt-16">
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Supporting Natural Processes</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">The primary goal is to restore dynamic natural processes – like forest growth, river dynamics, and natural grazing – that shape healthy ecosystems.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Working at Nature's Scale</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Rewilding often works best across larger, connected areas, allowing wildlife to move freely and ecosystems to function more naturally. However, significant benefits can also be achieved at smaller scales.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Letting Nature Lead</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Where possible, rewilding prioritises allowing nature to drive restoration, reducing intensive management and letting ecosystems self-organise.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Focusing on Ecological Function</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">The aim is to restore healthy, functioning ecosystems, rather than focusing solely on specific species or recreating a past landscape.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Creating Resilience</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Rewilding helps build ecosystems that are more resilient to challenges like climate change and disease.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Benefiting People</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Rewilding can provide significant benefits for people, including cleaner air and water, flood mitigation, carbon storage, and opportunities for nature-based economies and recreation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Using Nature-Based Solutions</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Rewilding is a key nature-based solution, harnessing the power of healthy ecosystems to address societal challenges.</p>

			<h3 class="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-balance 2xl:text-7xl text-white">Why Rewild? Restoring Nature, Reaping Rewards</h3>
			<p class="mt-8 text-xl text-white">Rewilding offers a wealth of benefits, not just for wildlife, but for our climate, communities, and economy too. By restoring natural processes, we can create landscapes that are healthier, more vibrant, and better equipped to support both nature and people.</p>
			<div class="mt-16 grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Boosting Biodiversity</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Restored habitats provide homes for a wider range of plants and animals, helping to reverse the decline in Scotland's precious wildlife. Think of capercaillie returning to regenerating pine forests or wading birds thriving in restored wetlands.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Fighting Climate Change</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Healthy ecosystems, particularly peatlands and woodlands, act as giant carbon sponges, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Rewilding helps restore these vital carbon stores and builds resilience to climate impacts like flooding and drought.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Enhancing Community Wellbeing</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Access to thriving natural environments improves our physical and mental health. Rewilding projects can create new opportunities for recreation, education, volunteering, and connecting people with their local landscapes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rounded-3xl bg-cloud p-8">
					<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Supporting Sustainable Economies</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Rewilding can create new economic opportunities in rural areas, such as nature-based tourism, sustainable forestry, and enterprises linked to restored ecosystems. It can also enhance vital ecosystem services like water purification and pollination.</p>
